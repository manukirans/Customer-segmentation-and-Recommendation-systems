### Project Title: Customer Insight and Targeted Recommendations

This project leverages machine learning to enhance customer understanding and product recommendations for retailers. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, outlier detection, customer segmentation using K-Means clustering, and the development of a recommendation system tailored to each segment.


### Problem Statement
Retailers often struggle to understand customer behavior deeply and personalize product recommendations, leading to missed sales opportunities.

### Solution
This project aims to analyze customer purchase data to identify distinct customer segments and develop a recommendation system that suggests top-selling products within each segment, boosting customer engagement and sales.

### Methodology

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removal of invoices with cancellations or returns (indicated by 'C' prefixes).
- Handling missing values.

### Feature Engineering
- Calculating metrics like total transactions, spending, average purchase values, purchase frequency.
- Extracting buying patterns (seasonal trends, spending increases/decreases).

### Outlier Detection
- Employing Isolation Forest algorithm to identify and remove potential outliers that could skew the analysis.

### Data Transformation
- Standardization using StandardScaler for better model performance.
- Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to capture essential patterns.

### Customer Segmentation
- Applying K-Means clustering to the transformed data to group customers with similar purchasing behaviors.
- Using the Elbow method and metrics like Silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### Recommendation System
- Identifying top-selling products within each cluster.
- Suggesting top products to individual customers based on their cluster, excluding items they've already purchased.

##@ Target Audience
- Retailers: Optimize marketing strategies and product placement.
- E-commerce Businesses: Enhance customer experience and increase conversions.
- Data analysts: Interested in customer segmentation and recommendation techniques.

### Potential Applications
- Targeted Promotions: Tailor offers and discounts based on customer segments.
- Personalized Product Displays: Adjust website layouts to feature relevant products.
- Inventory Management: Forecast demand based on segment preferences.
